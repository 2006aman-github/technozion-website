        content: `NITW's cultural fest, Spring Spree, is an event that brings students from various colleges together to showcase their talents and compete in various cultural events. For many students, it is a time to enjoy and have fun. However, for some, it is an opportunity to make lifelong friends.<br>I will share my experience of how I made lifelong friends during the fest.<br>Although I was a second-year student at NITW, I had zero experience with campus life due to COVID. I had just arrived on campus and within one month we had a fest lined up. I was excited to attend SpringSpree. I had heard about the fest from my seniors and was looking forward to participating in some of the events.<br>During the fest, I participated in several events, and while I enjoyed the experience, I found it challenging to interact with other students. I was shy and found it hard to strike up conversations with strangers. However, this changed when I participated in a group event with other students.<br>I found that I was more comfortable interacting with others when I was part of a group. I started chatting with my teammates, and we bonded over our common interests. We supported each other during the events and even practiced together for the next event.
        As the day progressed, I found that I was becoming more comfortable around my teammates and started hanging out with them during breaks. We explored the various stalls and food counters together and even watched some of the performances.<br>At the end of the day, we ended up making a WhatsApp group and discussed our plan for the next day of the fest. We spent the next two days of the fest together and made some unforgettable memories. Over the next few weeks, we continued to chat and even made plans to meet up during the weekends.<br>Over time, my teammates became my closest friends in college. We continued to participate in various events together and even traveled to other colleges for cultural fests. We supported each other during our highs and lows and were always there for each other.<br>For us, Spring Spree was not just a cultural fest; it was an opportunity to make lifelong friends. I am grateful to the fest for helping me come out of my shell and making me more comfortable around others.<br>Spring Spree not only provides a platform for students to showcase their talents, but it also helps students develop social skills and build relationships that last a lifetime.
